DESCRIPTION
    Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon is the Perl module that implements the
    multi_dnsbl daemon.

    multi_dnsbl is a DNS emulator daemon that increases the efficacy of
    DNSBL look-ups in a mail system. multi_dnsbl may be used as a
    stand-alone DNSBL or as a plug-in for a standard BIND 9 installation.
    multi_dnsbl shares a common configuration file format with the
    Mail::SpamCannibal sc_BLcheck.pl script so that DNSBL's can be
    maintained in a common configuration file for an entire mail
    installation.

    Because DNSBL usefulness is dependent on the nature and source of spam
    sent to a specific site and because sometimes DNSBL's may provide
    intermittant service, multi_dnsbl interrogates them sorted in the order
    of greatest successful hits. DNSBL's that do not respond within the
    configured timeout period are not interrogated at all after 6
    consecutive failures, and thereafter will be retried not more often than
    once every hour until they come back online. This eliminates the need to
    place DNSBL's in a particular order in your MTA's config file or
    periodically monitor the DNSBL statistics and/or update the MTA config
    file.

    In addition to optimizing DNSBL interrogation, multi_dnsbl may be
    configured to locally accept or reject specified IP's, IP ranges and to
    reject specified countries by 2 character country code. By adding a
    DNSBL entry of in-addr.arpa, IP's will be rejected that do not return
    some kind of valid reverse DNS lookup. In addition, IP's can be rejected
    that have a PTR record that matchs a configurable GENERIC 'regexp' set.

    Reject codes are as follows:

      query 2.0.0.127.{zonename}    127.0.0.2
      blocked by configured DNSBL   127.0.0.2
      no reverse DNS                127.0.0.4
      BLOCKED (local blacklist)     127.0.0.5
      Blocked by Country            127.0.0.6
      Blocked GENERIC               127.0.0.7

OPERATION
    The configuration file for multi_dnsbl contains optional IGNORE (always
    pass), optional BLOCK (always reject), and optional BBC (block by
    country) entries against which all received queries are checked before
    external DNSBL's are queried. IP's which pass IGNORE, BLOCK, and BBC
    test are then checked against the prioritized list of DNSBL's to try
    when looking up an IP address for blacklisting. Internally, multi_dnsbl
    maintains this list in sorted order (including 'in-addr.arpa') based on
    the number of responses that resulted in an acceptable A record being
    returned from the DNSBL query. For each IP address query sent to
    multi_dnsbl, a query is sent to each configured DNSBL sequentially until
    all DNSBL's have been queried or an acceptable A record is returned.

    Let us say for example that blackholes.easynet.nl (below) will return an
    A record and list.dsbl.org, bl.spamcop.net, dynablock.easynet.nl, will
    not.

                    LIST
            9451    list.dsbl.org
            6516    bl.spamcop.net
            2350    dynablock.easynet.nl
            575     blackholes.easynet.nl
            327     cbl.abuseat.org
            309     dnsbl.sorbs.net
            195     dnsbl.njabl.org
            167     sbl.spamhaus.org
            22      spews.dnsbl.net.au
            6       relays.ordb.org
            1       proxies.blackholes.easynet.nl
            0       dsbl.org

    A query to multi_dnsbl (pseudo.dnsbl in this example) looks like this

            QUERY
      1.2.3.4.pseudo.dnsbl
              |
              V
      ####################
      #    multi_dnsbl   #
      ####################
       |                                  RESPONSE
       +--> 1.2.3.4.list.dsbl.org         NXDOMAIN
       |
       +--> 1.2.3.4.bl.spamcop.net        NXDOMAIN
       |
       +--> 1.2.3.4.dynablock.easynet.nl  NXDOMAIN
       |
       +--> 1.2.3.4.blackholes.easynet.nl A-127.0.0.2

    The A record is returned to originator of the Query and the statistics
    count on blackholes.easynet.nl is incremented by one.

INSTALLATION / CONFIGURATION / OPERATION
    multi_dnsbl can be installed as either a standalone DNSBL or as a
    plug-in to a BIND 9 installation on the same host. In either case, copy
    the rc.multi_daemon script to the appropriate startup directory on your
    host and modify the start, stop, restart scripts as required. Operation
    of the script is as follows:

      Syntax: ./rc.multi_dnsbl start    /path/to/config.file
              ./rc.multi_dnsbl start -v /path/to/config.file
              ./rc.multi_dnsbl stop     /path/to/config.file
              ./rc.multi_dnsbl restart  /path/to/config.file

      The -v switch will print the scripts 
      actions verbosely to the STDERR.

  CONFIGURATION FILE

    The configuration file for multi_dnsbl shares a common format with the
    Mail::SpamCannibal sc_BLcheck.pl script, facilitating common maintenance
    of DNSBL's for your MTA installation.

    The sample configuration file multi_dnsbl.conf.sample is heavily
    commented with the details for each configuration element. If you plan
    to use a common configuration file in a SpamCannibal installation,
    simply add the following elements to the sc_BlackList.conf file:

      MDstatfile     => '/path/to/statistics/file.txt',
      MDpidpath      => '/path/to/pidfiles', # /var/run
      MDzone         => 'pseudo.dnsbl',

      # OPTIONAL
      MDstatrefresh => 300,       # seconds
      MDipaddr      => '0.0.0.0', # PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT
      MDport        => 9953,
      MDcache       => 10000,     # an entry takes ~400 bytes
                                  # default 10000 (to small)
  
    ### WARNING ### failure to set MDipaddr to a valid ip address will
    result in the authority section return an NS record of INADDR_ANY This
    will return an invalid NS record in stand alone operation

  STANDALONE OPERATION

    For standalone operation, simply set MDport = 53, nothing more is
    required.

    Interrogating the installation will then return the first match from the
    configured list of DNSBL servers.

      i.e.  dig 2.0.0.127.pseudo.dnsbl

            .... results

  PLUGIN to BIND 9

    multi_dnsbl may be used as a plugin helper for a standard bind 9
    installation by adding a forward zone to the configuration file as
    follows:

      //zone pseudo.dnsbl
      zone "pseudo.dnsbl" in {
            type forward;
            forward only;
            forwarders { 
                127.0.0.1 port 9953;
            };
      };

    You may also wish to add one or more of the following statements with
    appropriate address_match_lists to restrict access to the facility.

            allow-notify {};
            allow-query { address_match_list };
            allow-recursion { address_match_list };
            allow-transfer {};      

  MTA CONFIGURATION

    Access to DNSBL lookup is configured in the normal fashion for each MTA.
    Since MTA's generally must interrogate on port 53, multi_dnsbl must be
    installed on a stand-alone server or as a plugin for BIND 9.

    A typical configuration line for sendmail M4 configuration file is shown
    below:

      FEATURE(`dnsbl',`pseudo.dnsbl',
      `554 Rejected $&{client_addr} found in http://www.my.blacklist.org')dnl

SYSTEM SIGNALS
    multi_dnsbl responds to the following system signals:

    * TERM
        Operations the statistics file is updated with the internal counts
        and the daemon then exits.

    * HUP
        Operations are stopped including an update of the optional
        statistics file, the configuration file is re-read and operations
        are restarted.

    * USR1
        The statistics file is updated on the next second tick.

    * USR2
        The statistics file is deleted, internal statistics then a new
        (empty) statistics file is written on the next second tick.

PERL MODULE DESCRIPTION
    Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon provides most of the functions that implement
    multi_dnsbl which is an MTA helper that interrogates a list of DNSBL
    servers in preferential order based on their success rate.

    The following describes the workings of individual functions used to
    implement multi_dnsbl.

    * run($BLzone,$L,$R,$DNSBL,$STATs,$Run,$Sfile,$StatStamp,$DEBUG);
        This function is the 'run' portion for the DNSBL multidaemon

          Zone labels that are not of the form *.*... are ignored, making
          this hash table fully compatible with the SpamCannibal
          sc_Blacklist.conf file.

        * $STATs
          A pointer to a statistics collection array of the form:

            $STATs = {
                  'domain.name' => count,
                  etc...,
                  'CountryCode' => count,
                  etc...
            };

          Initialize this array with cntinit($DNSBL,$cp) the
          Net::DNSBL::Utilities manpage/cntinit, then list2hash($BBC,$cp)
          the Net::DNSBL::Utilities manpage/list2hash, then
          statinit($Sfile,$cp) the Net::DNSBL::Utilities manpage/statinit,
          below.

        * $Run
          A POINTER to the time in seconds to refresh the $STATs backing
          file. Even if there is not backing file used, this value must be a
          positive integer. Setting this value to zero will stop the daemon
          and force a restart. It is used by $SIG{HUP} to restart the
          daemon.

        * $Sfile
          The path to the STATISTICS backing file.

            i.e.  /some/path/to/filename.ext

          If $Sfile is undefined, then the time stamp need not be defined

        * $StatTimestamp
          Normally the value returned by statinit($Sfile,$cp) the
          Net::DNSBL::Utilities manpage/statinit, below.

    *
    bl_lookup($put,$mp,$rtp,$sinaddr,$alarm,$rid,$id,$rip,$type,$zone,@blist
    );
        Generates a query message for the first DNSBL in the @blist array.
        Creates a thread entry for the response and subsequent queries
        should the first one fail.

          input:        put,
                        message pointer,
                        remote thread pointer,
                        sockinaddr,
                        connection timeout,
                        remote id or undef to create
                        id of question,
                        reverse IP address in text
                        type of query received, (used in response)
                        ORIGINAL zone (case preserved),
                        array of remaining DNSBL's in sorted order
          returns:      nothing, puts stuff in thread queue

          extra:        if URBL processing is required,
                        $remoteThreads{$rid}->{urbl}
                        is set to the domain to look up

    * set_extension($pointer);
        This function sets a pointer to user defined extensions to
        Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon.

        Pointer is of the form:

                $Extension ->{
                        OPCODE   => value,
                        CLASS    => subref->($Extension,internal args),
                        NAME     => subref->($Extension,internal args),
                        TYPE     => subref->($Extension,internal args),
                        LOOKUP   => subref->($Extension,internal args),
                        ANSWER   => subref->($Extension,internal args),
                        NOTFOUND => subref->($Extension,internal args)
                };

        The pointer should be blessed into the package of the caller if the
        calling package needs to store persistant variables for its own
        instance. The subref will be called with the first argument of
        $Extension.

        Care should be taken to NOT instantiate a %remoteThreads in the
        CLASS, NAME, TYPE section unless it is know that it will be found
        and expired/deleted.
