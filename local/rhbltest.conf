## Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon parameters

# the OPTIONAL name of a file that will contain 'hit' statistics for DNSBLS
# this file will be used to seed the sort order of DNSBL checking if it is
# present and will be updated with the 'added' counts of each run. If it
# is deleted, it will be recreated with a new time tag at the beginning.
#
  MDstatfile      => '/usr/local/spamcannibal/mdstats.txt',

# The path for the directory where the pid file will live
#
  MDpidpath       => '/var/run',

# The zone name for this PSEUDO DNSBL
#
  MDzone          => 'pseudo.dnsbl',

###### The following optional configuration parameters
###### are shown with their default values
#
# Update frequency for the "stats" file, no
# update occurs if there is no new information
#
#  MDstatrefresh => 300,        # seconds
# The IPaddress that the daemon will listen on.
# The default will listen on ALL interfaces,   
# this is probably not what you want. A more   
# suitable value for co-installation with bind 
# on the same host would be 127.0.0.1
#
  MDipaddr        => '127.0.0.1',

# The port that the daemon will listen on
#
  MDport         => 12000,

# Syslog facility. Specify one of:
# LOG_EMERG LOG_ALERT LOG_CRIT LOG_ERR LOG_WARNING LOG_NOTICE LOG_INFO LOG_DEBU
#
  MDsyslog        => 'LOG_ERR',

# DNSBL lookup cache, uses the TTL provided by the lookup DNSBL
# this is only useful for STANDALONE operation. When used as
# an add-on to BIND, BIND will provide the caching
# cache size below 10000 will default to 10000.  
# suggested cache size 20,000 to 50,000
# each cache entry takes about 400 bytes
#
#  MDcache         => 10000,

# Do rhbl lookups only, default false
# all other rejection classes are disabled, IGNORE, BLOCK, BBC, in-addr.arpa
# RHBL need only be "true" for operation. If OPTIONAL URBL conditioning
# is needed, then the parameters in the has must be added
  RHBL 	=> {	# optional URBL preparation
	urblwhite => [
		'cache/white',
	],
# NOTE: level 3 tld's should be first before level 2 tld's

# FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL DNSBL ZONES, SEE:
#	http://www.openrbl.org
# click "zones"
#
# all dnsbl servers must have a record a config entry as follows:
#
# 'zone.name'	=> {
	acceptany   => 'comment - treat any response as valid',
#    # or
#	accept	    => {	# a list of codes that are ok to add to tarpit from this DNSBL
#	 	'127.0.0.2' => 'reason',
#		'127.0.0.3' => 'reason',
#	},
#
#  WARNING !!! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION WITH DNSBL HOSTS THAT REPORT TARPIT ACTIVITY
#
#	confirm     => 1,			# optional, confirmation of acceptance of non - 127.0.0.2 codes
#
#	response    => '127.0.0.3',		# optional, our default response code for records
#						# added because of queries to this DNSBL server
#						# this code will be ignored if it is < 127.0.0.3
#						# and 127.0.0.3 will be used in its place
#
#  error message to use with this host. 
#  NOTE: if the DNSBL supplies a TXT record and it contains the string "http://something..." or 
#  "www.something..." then that will be use for the error string for the matching A record. 
#  Otherwise, the error string below will be appended to the whatever TXT is returned by the 
#  DNSBL. If no TXT is returned, then the "reason" code from the "accept" line for the matching 
#  127.0.0.X code will be use and the error code below will be appended.
#
#  If the error string ending matches /\?.+=$/ or /\?$/
#  then the offending IP address will be automagically added
#
#	error	    => 'IP address blocked, see http://www.somehost.com?ip=',
#
#	expire	    => '7d',	# optional default expiration if DNSBL can not be reached
#				# may be specified in any combination of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks
#				#  i.e. 604800 or 604800s, 10080m, 168h
#				#	1w 3d
#
#	timeout	    => 30,	# default seconds to wait for dnsbl query to timeout

# WARNING!!     The default timeout in sendmail for DNS queries is "5 seconds"
#		If this configuration is used with Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon it is
#		recommended that the timeouts here be set to 5 seconds and that the
#		timeout parameter in the SENDMAIL m4 configuration build file for lookups be
#		extended to at least 15 seconds -- particularly if you invoke reverse lookups
#		with the in-addr.arpa parameter below.
