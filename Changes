	Having a little cockpit trouble today :-) Left out the
	initialization for response when no in-addr.arpa record is found.
	The nscount and arcount passed through from the PTR record must be 
	set to zero.

	in-addr.arpa queries did not accept SERVFAIL responses as

	WARNING, you need to upgrade your rc.multi_daemon if this
	if you have a previously installed version of this module.

	split MultiDaemon into two modules so the utilities are 
	available to new applications.

	Created Net::DNSBL::Utilities

	add logic to always allow 'IGNORE' block
	add logic to always reject 'BLOCK' block
	add logic to Block By Country
	add logic to reject failed reverse DNS

	sockaddr_in does not always ask for scalar arguments 
	as expected on some perl/OS combinations, therefore
	scalar arguments must be provided... in particular for 
	the output of Net::DNS::ToolKit::get_ns which uses 
	want_array (xs) to return scalar or array values.
	Thanks to "Gary E. Miller" <gem@rellim.com> for spotting this bug.
